## FEEDBACK & ITERATIONS

These documents are yours. Adapt them:
- If a tactic doesn't work, kill it
- If you find something better, use it
- If messaging feels inauthentic, change it
- If timeline is unrealistic, adjust it

The goal isn't perfect execution of this plan.
The goal is **launching AgentTodo successfully and getting users.**

Everything else is details.
