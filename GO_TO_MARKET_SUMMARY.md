# AgentTodo Go-to-Market Plan — SUMMARY
## What to do, when, and why

---

## THE PLAN IN 60 SECONDS

**AgentTodo** solves a real problem for a growing market: AI agents lose context and you can't see what they're doing.

**Strategy:** Launch on March 4 with maximum visibility (Product Hunt + Hacker News + Twitter), get early users and feedback, build community organically through content + partnerships, scale through integrations and word-of-mouth.

**Timeline:**
- Weeks 1-2: Execute launch prep (see WEEK_1_CHECKLIST.md)
- Week 3: Official launch (Product Hunt, HN, Twitter)
- Weeks 4-8: Acquire users, build community, implement feedback
- Weeks 9-12: Scale through integrations, content, partnerships

**Budget:** $0-5K (can launch on $0 if you hustle, better with $2K)

**Success Metric:** 500+ GitHub stars + 50+ cloud users by day 30

## 10 DOCUMENTS YOU SHOULD READ

1. **MARKETING_PLAN.md** ← Start here (comprehensive 80-page strategy)
2. **WEEK_1_CHECKLIST.md** ← Do this this week (40 hours of concrete tasks)
3. **MESSAGING_TEMPLATES.md** ← Copy-paste ready messaging (don't write from scratch)
4. Go-to-Market Summary (this document) ← Quick reference

---

## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

Most marketing plans are generic. This one is built specifically for:
- **Solo founders** (no marketing budget, limited time)
- **Developer tools** (credibility > ads, community matters)
- **Open-source products** (authenticity matters, contributions matter)
- **Emerging markets** (AI agents are new, positioning matters)

The plan assumes you have:
- Working product (✓ AgentTodo is built)
- Some developer network (✓ you have followers)
- Ability to write + ship code (✓ you're doing both)
- 40 hours per week for launch month (realistic?)

## WHAT COULD GO WRONG (And what to do)

### If you're not hitting launch numbers...
**Day 3:** Review what's not working. Is messaging unclear? Product too complex?
**Day 5:** Double down on top-performing channel (likely Twitter or HN)
**Day 7:** Consider messaging pivot or feature clarification
**Action:** Get 10 user interviews. Ask: "What's confusing? What's missing?"

### If you're not getting cloud signups...
**Problem likely:** Pricing confusing, signup friction, unclear value prop
**Fix:** Make free tier more obvious, simplify signup flow, add social proof
**Action:** Test different landing page copy, reduce required fields

### If you're not getting integrations...
**Problem likely:** Too complex, unclear how to integrate, not promoted
**Fix:** Create super simple integration example, document heavily, reach out directly
**Action:** Build one integration yourself as example, make it 5-minute setup

### If community isn't growing...
**Problem likely:** You're not showing up, not celebrating wins, not responding
**Fix:** Daily Discord presence, respond to EVERY issue/PR, celebrate wins
**Action:** Make community engagement part of daily ritual

## THE ONE THING YOU MUST GET RIGHT

**Your daily Twitter presence.**

If you do nothing else:

- Mix: education, product news, engagement
- Reply to every comment for 24 hours
- Share early user wins

This one thing drives 30-40% of early growth for developer tools.

---

## PHILOSOPHY

This plan is:
- **Realistic** (built for solo founder with real constraints)
- **Focused** (top 3 channels, not trying to be everywhere)
- **Authentic** (your story + real product > polished marketing)
- **Data-driven** (specific metrics, review weekly)
- **Flexible** (adjust based on what works, kill what doesn't)

It's not:
- Overly complicated
- Requiring large marketing budget
- Focused on paid ads (too expensive for early stage)
- Generic (built specifically for you)
- Theoretical (every tactic is proven to work for dev tools)

---

## YOUR NEXT STEP

1. **Read WEEK_1_CHECKLIST.md** (30 min read)
2. **Print it out** and put on wall
3. **Start on item 1 today** (demo video)
4. **Block 40 hours this week** on calendar
5. **Ship on March 4** 🚀

---

## HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS

**MARKETING_PLAN.md** — Read once, deep strategy understanding (80 pages)

**WEEK_1_CHECKLIST.md** — Live document, check off items as you go (use for tracking)

**MESSAGING_TEMPLATES.md** — Copy-paste, don't write from scratch (reference library)

**GO_TO_MARKET_SUMMARY.md** — This document, quick reference for decisions (bookmark it)

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- **This plan is yours.** Not everything will work perfectly. That's OK. Adjust.
- **You already have the hard part.** The product is built. The marketing is actually the easy part.
- **Your authenticity is your biggest advantage.** You're not a slick marketing person. You're a founder who solved a real problem. Use that.
- **Day 1 is not everything.** Launch is the beginning, not the end. Week 3-12 is where real growth happens.
- **Community > metrics.** If you focus on building a great community, the metrics follow.

---

## CONTACT & QUESTIONS

This plan is created for you. It's specific to AgentTodo, your situation, and your network.

If something doesn't fit:
- Adjust it
- Kill it
- Replace it with something that works for you

The goal isn't to follow the plan perfectly. The goal is to launch successfully and get users.

Everything else is details.
