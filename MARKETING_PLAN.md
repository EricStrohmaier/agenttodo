**Target Launch:** March 1-15, 2026
**Primary Goal:** 500+ GitHub stars, 50+ cloud signups in first 30 days
**Success Metric:** 10% of engaged developers returning monthly to check their agents

## FINAL NOTES FOR SUCCESS

### As a Solo Founder:

1. **Protect your focus** — Don't try to execute all 10 strategies simultaneously. Pick top 3 channels, go deep, then expand.

2. **Your authenticity is your biggest asset** — You built this because you had the problem. Use that story. People connect with real problems, not polished marketing.

3. **Community first, business second** — If you focus on genuine community building and user value, the business follows.

4. **Speed beats perfection** — A "done" blog post published day 1 beats a perfect post never written. Ship, learn, improve.

5. **You're not competing on marketing budget** — You're competing on product quality + authenticity. These beat paid ads.

6. **Track top 3 metrics only** — Don't obsess over everything. Pick: GitHub stars, cloud signups, MRR. Review weekly.

7. **Respond to every early user** — These first 100 users will build your foundation. Make them feel special.

8. **Celebrate small wins publicly** — Hit 100 stars? Tweet it. First paid customer? Announce it. Momentum builds momentum.

9. **Network strategically** — Those 50 early reach-outs to your network will drive 50% of initial users. Do these personally.

10. **Iterate based on real feedback** — Not every idea in this plan will work for you. Be willing to kill what's not working and double down on what is.
